I think I've found the problem of tessalation. If the size of the tile / frequency is less than 4, tiling occurs. 
All we have to do is modify the frequency with size and we can prevent tiling. 
This will need to be confirmed with more expermient but I think if we can modify the frequency based on image size, we can
prevent tessalation and instead get the tiling effect - which is preferable. I'm not sure why this occurs but we can 
elimanate the bug, so it's a win-win.
