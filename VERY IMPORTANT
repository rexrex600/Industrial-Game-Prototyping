I think I've found the problem of tessalation. If the size of the tile / frequency is less than 4, repetion occurs. 
All we have to do is modify the frequency with size and we can prevent repetion. 
This will need to be confirmed with more expermient but I think if we can modify the frequency based on image size, we can
prevent tessalation and instead get the tiling effect - which is preferable. I'm not sure why this occurs but we can 
elimanate the bug, so it's a win-win.
UPDATE - 5/12/14
The effect is true - for a 256x256 map, if the frequency is above 64, repetion occurs. 
If the frequency is below this, the maps are tilable (confirmed) but to not repeat on the map itself.

Effect confirmed by experiment:
256x256: Tested with frequencies 62,64,68. repetion only occured on 68
512x512: Tested with frequencies 126,128,130. repetion only occured on 130
1024x1024: Tested with frequencies 254,256,258. repetion only occured on 258

Findings:
If map_size/frequency <= 4:
  repetion does not occur, tiling does
Else:
  repetion occurs
I think we can use this to modify the frequency is your OOP version based on map size.#
Also Joe, upload the OOP version.
